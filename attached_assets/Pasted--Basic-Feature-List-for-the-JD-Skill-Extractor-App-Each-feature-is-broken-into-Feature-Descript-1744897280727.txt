 Basic Feature List for the JD Skill Extractor App
Each feature is broken into:

📌 Feature Description

🔧 Libraries/Tools

🔁 Workflow (Step-by-Step)

🧱 Architecture Principles Followed

🔹 Feature 1: Paste or Upload Job Description Text
📌 What it does:
Allows user to input a job description via:

Text area (manual paste)

File upload (optional)

🔧 Tools:
Streamlit for front-end

Python backend

File parsing with PyPDF2 or python-docx (if needed)

🔁 Workflow:
User opens the app

Inputs JD using:

st.text_area() for pasting

st.file_uploader() for uploading

Backend reads the text into a string for processing

🧱 Architecture Principles:
User-friendly interface

Modular input handling (text and file support)

🔹 Feature 2: Preprocess Job Description Text
📌 What it does:
Cleans the text for accurate skill extraction

🔧 Libraries:
spaCy or nltk

re (regex)

🔁 Workflow:
Convert text to lowercase

Remove special characters and numbers

Tokenize sentences/words

Remove stopwords (like “and”, “the”, “with”)

Optional: Lemmatization (turns "running" → "run")

python
Copy
Edit
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(text)
cleaned_tokens = [token.lemma_ for token in doc if not token.is_stop and not token.is_punct]
🧱 Architecture Principles:
Clean layer separation: Preprocessing is a service module

Reusable pipeline components

🔹 Feature 3: Extract Key Technical Skills and Tools
📌 What it does:
Detects important tech skills like Python, SQL, Excel, etc.

🔧 Tools:
Skill list: Custom CSV or use O*NET skills data

Matching: fuzzywuzzy or simple in logic

NLP: spaCy for named entity recognition (NER)

🔁 Workflow:
Load curated skill dictionary (CSV of known skills)

Match skills in JD using:

Keyword matching

OR entity extraction (NER) via spaCy

python
Copy
Edit
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz
# Match "Pyton" with "Python" using ratio > threshold
🧱 Architecture Principles:
Decouples matching logic from UI

Future extensibility (e.g., use ML/NLP later)

🔹 Feature 4: Categorize Extracted Skills
📌 What it does:
Groups skills into categories like:

Programming Languages

Cloud Platforms

Soft Skills

Tools

🔧 Tools:
Simple mapping JSON

Optional: Pre-trained classifier (later)

🔁 Workflow:
Use a predefined skill-category map

Loop through extracted skills and assign categories

Display result as structured output

python
Copy
Edit
{
  "Python": "Programming",
  "Excel": "Tool",
  "AWS": "Cloud",
  "Communication": "Soft Skill"
}
🧱 Architecture Principles:
Uses a configuration layer (JSON/CSV)

Improves explainability and modularity

🔹 Feature 5: Display Results Clearly
📌 What it does:
Shows extracted & grouped skills visually.

🔧 Tools:
Streamlit for UI

Plotly or Altair for simple visualizations

🔁 Workflow:
Format skills as a list or chips

Use different colors for skill types

Optional: Bar chart showing frequency/count

python
Copy
Edit
import streamlit as st
st.markdown("**Required Tools:** Python, SQL, Tableau")
🧱 Architecture Principles:
UI is clean, readable, responsive

Separation of concerns between display logic and processing logic

🔹 Feature 6 (Bonus): Resume Matching
📌 What it does:
Matches user’s resume skills with the JD and shows skill gaps

🔧 Tools:
docx/PDF parser

Same skill matcher as used for JD

🔁 Workflow:
Upload resume (optional)

Extract resume skills

Compare to JD skills → show overlap + gaps

🧱 Architecture Principles:
Extensible microservice-style component

Adds user personalization for future use
